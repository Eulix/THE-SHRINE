# ICT1012 Lab Solutions

Example solutions. There are code comments explaining each solution.
Grading code has been removed as we do not own it.

Build xv6 and start it in a vm (use `ctrl+a, x` to exit):

```
make qemu
```

Remove intermidiate files for a clean build:

```
make clean
```

## Lab 1

### Task 1: sleep

file: [lab1/sleep.c](lab1/sleep.c)

### Task 2: memdump

file: [lab1/sleep.c](lab1/memdump.c)

## Contributing

1. Create a new lab\* folder for your lab solutions
2. Put your c files in the folder
3. Add the compiled programs to 'UPROGS' in the Makefile (e.g., `lab1/_sleep\`, `lab2/_xargs\`. DON'T use $U)
4. Update this README, pretty please.
5. **triple-check that you aren't committing any code from the professors or SiT.** They can sue you for that or something idk I'm not a lawyer.

This prevents duplicating the kernel and common user program codes for each lab,
and also prevents people from blindly copy-pasting the solutions verbatim. 😈

## Original README

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
